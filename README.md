# BlowHard
Simple zelda-like game

I used assets from this url: https://opengameart.org/content/blowhard-2-blow-harder

To run it :
  Navigate to the folder where the files are in a terminal, and execute : "python3 -m http.server" 
  the game will be hosted on the port 8000, access it in ur webbrowser via : "localhost:8000" .
  
  or host it on any http server you like ...
